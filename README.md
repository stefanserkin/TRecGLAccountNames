# TRec GL Account Names

Itâ€™s helpful to have the common name of GL accounts available on record pages and in list views and reports. The Journal Entry, Transaction Line Item, Daily GL Account Summary and Future Journal Entry objects in the Traction Rec managed package all have at least one property representing a GL code. This solution attempts to provide a corresponding account name in each of these cases.
